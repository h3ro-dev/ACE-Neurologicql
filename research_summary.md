# Trauma Mapping Research Summary

This document outlines the developmental neuroscience references used to update `ace.html`.

- **Bullying**: Studies indicate that both male and female adolescents show increased amygdala reactivity to social rejection. Boys also display elevated striatal involvement with risk-taking behaviors.
- **Community Violence**: Exposure during early teens activates reward and fear circuitry, particularly the striatum and amygdala in boys. Girls in preadolescence demonstrate stronger amygdala responses.
- **Loss of a Loved One**: Research notes prolonged amygdala activation in bereaved girls during late childhood and early adolescence.
- **Parental Separation or Divorce**: Mid-adolescent boys often show striatal-driven reward seeking, whereas girls exhibit more limbic (amygdala) activation associated with mood symptoms.

These findings informed adjustments to the `traumaBrainRegions` object to provide age- and gender-specific mappings.
